description: Getting Started with Cloud Foundry
---

The Cloud Foundry Tech Preview is a sneak peek at the new and improved Cloud Foundry. If you do not have an invitation to join the Tech Preview, don't worry - we will be opening it up to a broader audience soon.

As some of Cloud Foundry's architecture and workflows have been updated, we will be using this area as a placeholder for documentation. When the Tech Preview is over, and Cloud Foundry is generally available, the existing documentation will be archived and replaced with the materials found here.

# Getting Started

1. Register for a Cloud Foundry account [here](http://coming-soon).

2. Install one or both of the Cloud Foundry tools that you use to deploy and manage applications:

	+ [VMC](/techpreview/tools/vmc/installing-vmc.html) is a general purpose command line tool for Cloud Foundry.
	+ [Cloud Foundry extension to Spring Tool Suite (STS) or Eclipse](/techpreview/tools/STS/configuring-STS.html) is for Spring developers.

5. [Deploy your application using VMC or STS.](/techpreview/tools/deploying-apps.html)

    This step includes creating service instances, binding the service
    instances to your application, and managing the lifecycle of your
    deployed application.
