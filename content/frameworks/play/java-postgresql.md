This is a guide for Java developers using Play framework and mysql database to build and 
deploy their apps and deploy on Cloud Foundry. It shows you how to set up and successfully 
deploy Play Java Postgresql applications to Cloud Foundry.



Before you get started, you need the following:

+	A [Cloud Foundry account](http://cloudfoundry.com/signup)

+	The [vmc](/tools/vmc/installing-vmc.html) Cloud Foundry command line tool

+	A [Play 2.0 ](http://www.playframework.org/documentation/2.0.2/Home) installation

## Introduction

In this tutorial we take a simple use case : 

[TodoList App]( http://www.playframework.org/documentation/2.0.2/JavaTodoList ) app described 
in the Play Framework website and show how to deploy it on Cloud Foundry and the persistent
layer wired to Postgresql database.

## TodoList Play App

TodoList is used to create and manage tasks.

These tasks are created by the users and the data
is stored in underlying relational store.
The default tutorial stores tasks in the embedded database which comes with the Play framework.

Various components of the app can be found in [Todo List App Overview]( /frameworks/play/todolistjavaapp.html ) document.


## Build and run the App Locally
The app can be run locally using the standard command from within the app folder

``` bash
$play run
```
The following screen appears the first time as the evolution script needs to be applied and
tables created

Once the user pressess the ApplyScript button the actual app home shows up

### Modifying the evolutions file for Postgresql

There is no need to modify or delete the default evolutions file generated by Play Framework.

## Deploy the App on Cloud Foundry
Deployment to Cloud Foundry can be done in two simple steps

+	Create a distribution
+	Push the distribution using `vmc push`

Commands below show the exact commands and output when the app is deployed 

``` bash
$ play dist
[info] Loading project definition from /Users/[username]/play/mysamples/todolist-java-mysql/project
[info] Set current project to todolist-java-mysql (in build file:/Users/rajdeepd/vmware/play/mysamples/todolist-java-mysql/)
