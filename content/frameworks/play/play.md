Play is based on a lightweight, stateless, web-friendly architecture and features predictable
and minimal resource consumption (CPU, memory, threads) for highly-scalable applications.

Play 2.0 is a first class citizen among other frameworks in Cloud Foundry ecosystem.
Cloud Foundry provides a runtime environment for Play 2.0 applications and the Cloud Foundry
deployment tools automatically recognize Play applications.
