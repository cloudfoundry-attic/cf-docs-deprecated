Play is based on a lightweight, stateless, web-friendly architecture and features predictable
and minimal resource consumption (CPU, memory, threads) for highly-scalable applications.

Play 2.0 is a first class citizen among other frameworks in the Cloud Foundry ecosystem.
Cloud Foundry provides a runtime environment for Play 2.0 applications and the Cloud Foundry
deployment tools automatically recognize Play applications.

Before you get started, you need the following:

+  A [Cloud Foundry account](http://cloudfoundry.com/signup)

+  The [vmc](/tools/vmc/installing-vmc.html) Cloud Foundry command line tool

+  A [Play 2.0 ](http://www.playframework.org/documentation/2.0.2/Home) installation
