##Introduction

This tutorial will teach you how to setup the application from the downloaded source code before starting the respective chapters.

+ Ruby-1.9.2-p180 should be installed on your machine via `rvm`.

+ [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Quickstart) should be installed on your machine.

+ As there is `.rvmrc` file in application code, automatically it will use the particular ruby version along with gemset.

+ Install the gems specified in `Gemfile` by running the following command.

```bash
$ bundle install
```

+ Run the following command to populate the seed database. (Only for Excercise4-Starters.zip)

```bash
$ bundle exec rake db:seed
```

+ Its done. Now follow the <a href="javascript:javascript:history.go(-1)">tutorial</a> to continue.
