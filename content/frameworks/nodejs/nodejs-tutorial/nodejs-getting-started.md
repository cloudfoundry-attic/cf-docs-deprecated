## Objective

This is a guide for Node.js developers deploying on Cloud Foundry. It shows you how to set up and successfully deploy Node.js applications to Cloud Foundry using VMC.

## Prerequisites

This guide makes the following assumptions:

+ [Node.js](http://howtonode.org/how-to-install-nodejs) installed on your system to build node application.
+ [Cloud Foundry account](https://my.cloudfoundry.com/signup) to host the application on Cloud Foundry.
+ [Micro Cloud Foundry](http://railsdocs.cloudfoundry.com/infrastructure/micro/installing-mcf.html) installed on your machine (optional) to host the applications locally.
+ [VMC](http://railsdocs.cloudfoundry.com/tools/vmc/installing-vmc.html) installed on your system to manage the applications on Cloud Foundry.
+ You are proficient in developing node.js application.

+ [Getting Started with Cloud Foundry](http://docs.cloudfoundry.com/getting-started.html)

## Overview

### Node.js
[Node.js](http://nodejs.org) is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.
