## Node.js

#### What is it?

[Node.js](http://nodejs.org) is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

#### Advantages of Node.js:

+ Web development in a dynamic language (JavaScript) on a VM that is incredibly fast (V8). It is much faster than Ruby, Python, or Perl. Ability to handle thousands of concurrent connections with minimal overhead on a single process.
+ JavaScript is perfect for event loops with first class function objects and closures. People already know how to use it this way having used it in the browser to respond to user initiated events.
+ A lot of people already know JavaScript, even people who do not claim to be programmers. It is arguably the most popular programming language.
+ Using JavaScript on a web server as well as the browser reduces the impedance mismatch between the two programming environments which can communicate data structures via JSON that work the same on both sides of the equation. Duplicate form validation code can be shared between server and client, etc.

## Sockjs
[SockJS](https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-node) is a JavaScript library (for browsers) that provides a WebSocket-like object. SockJS gives you a coherent, cross-browser, Javascript API which creates a low latency, full duplex, cross-domain communication channel between the browser and the web server, with WebSockets or without. This necessitates the use of a server, which this is one version of, for Node.js.

## Express
Express is a minimal and flexible node.js web application framework, providing a robust set of features for building single and multi-page, and hybrid web applications.
 
## Fabric js
+ Fabric.js is a framework that makes it easy to work with HTML5 canvas element.
+ It is an interactive object model on top of canvas element.
+ It is also an SVG-to-canvas (and canvas-to-SVG) parser.
