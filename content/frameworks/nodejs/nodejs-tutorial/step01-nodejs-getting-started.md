This is a guide for Node.js developers deploying on Cloud Foundry. It shows you how to set up and successfully deploy Node.js applications to Cloud Foundry.

Node.js is an event-driven, scalable, JavaScript-based platform for networking applications. Cloud Foundry provides a runtime environment for Node.js applications and the Cloud Foundry deployment tools automatically recognize Node.js applications.

Before you get started, you need the following:

+	A [Cloud Foundry account](http://cloudfoundry.com/signup)

+	The [vmc](/tools/vmc/installing-vmc.html) Cloud Foundry command line tool

+	A [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installation matching the version of Node.js on your Cloud Foundry instance. 
See [Checking the NodeJS version on your Cloud Foundry instance](#checking-the-nodejs-version-on-your-cloud-foundry-instance) below.
