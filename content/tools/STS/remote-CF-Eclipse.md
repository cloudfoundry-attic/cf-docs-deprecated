## Remote File Access

The Cloud Foundry Integration extension provides a file browser that you can use to
view files deployed to Cloud Foundry. For example, you can view configuration
files and log files on the remote Cloud Foundry server.

Follow these steps to access the Remote Systems View.

*  Select **Window > Show View > Servers**.

*  In the Servers view, expand a Cloud Foundry server and double-click on a deployed application.

*  Under the Application Details pane, click **Remote Systems View**.

   that are available to you.
